<h1>A small village!</h1>
<p>Once upon a time there was a small village. The village had many fishermen. The weird part of the village was that there was no water anywhere closeby.</p>
<p>That didn't bother the fishermen though, as they fished from rainy clouds. As we all know, rainy clouds contain fish -- why else would there be water in the clouds?</p>
